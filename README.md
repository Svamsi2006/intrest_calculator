Example
For a principal of â‚¹34400, rate of 2% per month, from 2025-03-27 to 2025-07-30 (4 months and 3 days), with simple interest:


Duration: 0 Years, 4 Months, 3 Days
Interest: â‚¹2820.80
Total Amount: â‚¹37220.80
Calculation Steps (in English):
Monthly Interest = P * (rate/100) = 34400 * 0.02 = â‚¹688.00

Interest for 4 full months = 688.00 * 4 = â‚¹2752.00

Interest for 3 remaining days = (688.00 / 30) * 3 = â‚¹68.80

Total Simple Interest = â‚¹2752.00 + â‚¹68.80 = â‚¹2820.80

The steps are translated into Telugu, Tamil, or Kannada based on the selected language.
